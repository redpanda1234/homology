* When I see an induced homomorphism, what's the first thing that should jump to my mind?
** Intuition-wise, that is.
* To be clear in our definition of the degree of a map:
** First, we use continuity from S^n -> S^n to get a simplicial map on triangulations?
** Then, we use this simplicial map to get our induced homomorphism on homology groups?
* How exactly to prove the homology groups of S^n ?
* Let's talk about the degree of a map, and how to prove the theorems.
** "If f and g are homotopic, they have the same degree."
*** This seems like it should be pretty obvious, given the previous lemma.
* Lefschetz:
** Holy crap! Is this some rep theory showing up????????
*** We talk about matrix rep. of a homomorphism. Really, this feels like it could be thought of in terms of some kind of symmetry group permuting the elements of the basis in some valid way.
*** In this context, the trace things seem a little like characters????
