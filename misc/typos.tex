\section*{Chapter 11}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple typo. Section 11.4, page 194: ``Intuitively, we know what
    {\color{red} at} hole is.'' Should be ``what {\color{green} a} hole is.''
  \item Ambiguous parse structure. Section 11.4, page 194: ``Another category of
    theorem we will prove is fixed point theorems.'' While this sentence is
    grammatically correct if parsed as ``Another (category of (theorem we will
    prove)) is (fixed point theorems),'' it is easy for a first-time reader to
    parse the sentece as ``Another (category of theorem) we will prove is (fixed
    point theorems),'' which I think has a number agreement error (``category of
    theorem'' is singular, ``is'' is singular, ``fixed point theorems'' is
    plural --- easy to not realize ``fixed point theorems'' is the title of the
    category). Not sure if this is actually a problem though.
  \item Number agreement error. Section 11.4, page 195: ``Another type of
    theorem that we will prove {\color{red} are} theorems about geometric
    separation.'' This is sort of the dual of the part above --- ``type of
    theorem that we will prove'' is singular no matter how you parse it, ``are''
    is plural.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Chapter 12}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Notational error. Exercise 12.1, page 199: ``Show that the torus
    {\color{red}$T^2$} is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$.''
    Torus should be denoted $\mathbb{T}^2$.
\end{itemize}
