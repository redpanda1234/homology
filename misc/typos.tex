\section*{Chapter 3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Notational inconsistency. Section 3.1, page 53: ``there is a designated
    set $U_x$ in {\color{red} X} with $x \in U_x$ such that $f(U_x) \subset
    V$.'' Here, the {\color{red} X} should be in math font, i.e.\
    ${\color{green} X}$.
  \item Possible undesirable formatting. Section 3.1, page 55: in the statement
    of theorem 3.1 (``Let $\set{U_i}_{i=1}^n$ be a finite collection of open
    sets''), ``finite'' is not italicized, whereas the surrounding text is. This
    is likely due to the use of \verb|\emph| inside an italicized environment.
    While this is indeed the expected behavior, it might be worth considering
    using boldface instead to emphasize finite.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Chapter 4}

  \item
\end{itemize}
\section*{Chapter 11}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Simple typo. Section 11.4, page 194: ``Intuitively, we know what
    {\color{red} at} hole is.'' Should be ``what {\color{green} a} hole is.''
  \item Ambiguous parse structure. Section 11.4, page 194: ``Another category of
    theorem we will prove is fixed point theorems.'' While this sentence is
    grammatically correct if parsed as ``Another (category of (theorem we will
    prove)) is (fixed point theorems),'' it is easy for a first-time reader to
    parse the sentece as ``Another (category of theorem) we will prove is (fixed
    point theorems),'' which I think has a number agreement error (``category of
    theorem'' is singular, ``is'' is singular, ``fixed point theorems'' is
    plural --- easy to not realize ``fixed point theorems'' is the title of the
    category). Not sure if this is actually a problem though.
  \item Number agreement error. Section 11.4, page 195: ``Another type of
    theorem that we will prove {\color{red} are} theorems about geometric
    separation.'' This is sort of the dual of the part above --- ``type of
    theorem that we will prove'' is singular no matter how you parse it, ``are''
    is plural.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Chapter 12}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Notational error. Exercise 12.1, page 199: ``Show that the torus
    {\color{red}$T^2$} is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$.''
    Torus should be denoted $\mathbb{T}^2$.
\item Possible error. Section 12.1, page 201 --- ``The basis for the topology is
  the collection of {\color{red}open cones} with the cone point at the origin.''
  I believe this should be double cones?
  \item Possible grammatical error. Exercise 12.3.2, page 201 --- ``Show that
    $\RRP^2$ is also homeomorphic to a disk with two edges on its boundary
    (called a \textbf{bigon}){\bfseries \color{red},} identified as indicated in
    Figure 12.7.'' The comma should not appear --- removing the parenthetical
    expression, the comma creates an ungrammatical sentence.
