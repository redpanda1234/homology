\section*{Grading notes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Be more careful about rigor and precision initially, loosen up later
  \item Specs based grading (mastery-based grading)
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Relieve pressure w.r.t.\ grades
      \item See learning as meeting some targets?
      \item Make some threshold, if the proof passes, it passes. Else, resubmit
      \item To pass the specs-based portion, present >15 times in class, make a
        comment >15 times in class, contribute to solution set, edit what's
        there, and also make a notebook
      \item Notebook includes homework.
      \item Most important --- helpful comments. Don't worry too much about 3
        pts vs 5 pts, etc.
      \item Can also do binary classification (good enough vs. not good enough
        --- if do this, then ask for resubmit / corrections).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item OK so what should we do?
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Have some opportunity for regrades
      \item 5 point scale? 5 is well-written, correct (at most one point off if
        the writing is bad), 0 is didn't attempt, 1 is at least attempt, 2-4 are
        various levels of correctness
      \item regrades allowed below a 4/51
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Sets and Cardinality}
\begin{problem}[2.8]
  Prove that every subset of $\NN$ is either finite or has the same cardinality
  as $\NN$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  We first prove a small Lemma.

  \textbf{Lemma} Let $X$ be an infinite set. Then $\forall x \in X$, $X -
  \set{x}$ is infinite.

  \textbf{Proof of Lemma:} Suppose, to obtain a contradiction, that $\exists x_0
  \in X \st X - \set{x_0}$ is finite. Then $\exists n \in \NN \st \exists f : X
  - \set{x_0} \bij \set{1, \ldots, n}$. Then construct $f' : X \bij \set{1,
    \ldots, n}$ by taking
  \[
    f'(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      f(x) & \text{if}\ x \neq x_0 \\
      n+1 & \text{if}\ x = x_0
    \end{cases}
  \]
  and note that $f'$ is a bijection. It follows that $X$ is finite, a
  contradiction. Thus, $\forall x \in X$, $X - \set{x}$ is infinite.

  \textbf{Main Proof:}
  Let $X \subseteq \NN$. Suppose that $X$ is finite. Then we're done. Now,
  suppose $X$ is infinite. WTS $\abs{X} = \abs{\NN}$. We will apply the
  Well-Ordering Principle to construct $f : X \bij \NN$ as follows: let $X_1 =
  X$. Since $X_1$ is a nonempty set of natural numbers, there exists a least
  element $x_1 = \inf(X_1)$. Define $f(1) = x_1$. Now, take $X_2 = X_1 -
  \set{x_1}$. By the Lemma, $X_2$ is infinite as well. Applying a similar
  process, define $f(x_2) = \inf(X_2)$, and take $X_3 = X_2 - \set{x_2}$.
  In general $f(n+1) = \inf (X_{n+1}) = \inf (X_n - \set{x_n})$. By the lemma,
  we can continue this process indefinitely, yielding a bijection $f : X \bij
  \NN$. It follows that every subset of $\NN$ is either finite or has the same
  cardinality as $\NN$.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.9]
  Every infinite set has a countably infinite subset.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be an infinite set. Suppose $X$ is countable. Then $X \subset X$ is a
  countably infinite subset, as desired. Now suppose $X$ is uncountable. We
  apply the axiom of choice. Let $g : \mc P(X) - \set{\varnothing} \to X$ be a
  choice function. That is, $\forall S \subseteq X \st S \neq \varnothing$,
  $g(S) \in S$. Then define $f : \NN \into X$ as follows:
  \[
    f(n) =
    \begin{cases}
      g(X) & \text{if } n = 1 \\
      \displaystyle g\pn{X - \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} \set{f(i)}} & \text{if } n > 1
    \end{cases}
  \]
  We claim $f$ is injective. To see this, suppose, to obtain a contradiction,
  that $f$ is not injective. Then $\exists n,m \in \NN \st f(n) = f(m)$, and $n
  \neq m$. WLOG, suppose $n > m$. Then by definition,
  \[
    f(m) = f(n) \in X - \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} \set{f(i)}.
  \]
  but $m \in \set{1, \ldots, n-1}$, hence $f(m) \in \bigcup_{i=1}^{n=1}
  \set{f(i)}$ and $f(m) = f(n) \not \in X - \bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} \set{f(i)}$, a
  contradiction. Thus $f$ is injective. It follows that $f(\NN)$ is a countable
  subset of $X$, as desired.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.10]
  A set is infinite if and only if there is an injection from the set to a
  proper subset of itself.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}~
  \begin{iffproof}
    \item Let $X$ be an infinite set. Then there exists a countable subset $S =
      \set{s_1, \ldots, s_n, \ldots}$. Define $f : X \into X - \set{s_1}$ by
      \[
        f(x) =
        \begin{cases}
          x & \text{if } x \not \in S \\
          \mrm{succ}(x) & \text{if } x \in S.
        \end{cases}
      \]
      and note that this is an injection to a proper subset of $X$, as desired.
    \item Let $X$ be a set, and $S$ a proper subset of $X$. Suppose there exists
      an injection $f : X \into S$. WTS $X$ is infinite. Suppose, to obtain a
      contradiction, that $X$ were finite. Then $\exists n,m \in \NN \st \exists
      g : X \bij \set{1, \ldots, n}$, and $h : S \bij \set{1, \ldots, m}$, where
      $m < n$. Apply the pigeonhole principle to $g \circ f = h$ to obtain a
      contradiction.
  \end{iffproof}
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.14]
  Prove that the set of all finite subsets of a countable set is countable.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $X$ be a countable set, and consider the poset of finite subsets of $X$
  ordered by inclusion. One can show by induction that $\forall k \in \NN$, the
  st of $k$-element subsets of $\NN$ is countable. Apply this to obtain a
  bijection from the set of all finite subsets of $X$ to $\NN \times \NN$, which
  can be shown to be countable in the usual way.

  A much nicer proof is to first create a bijection from $X$ to the set of all
  primes, and then multiply things together.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.15]
  Suppose a submarine is moving in the plane along a straight line at a constant
  speed such that at each hour, the submarine is at a lattice point, that is, a
  point whose two coordinates are both integers. Suppose at each hour you can
  explode one depth charge at a lattice point that will hit the submarine if it
  is there. You do not know the submarine's direction, speed, or its current
  position. Prove that you can explode one depth charge each hour in such a way
  that you will be guaranteed to eventually hit the submarine.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let the initial position of the submarine be given by $(x_0, y_0) \in \ZZ
  \times \ZZ$. Then $\exists v_x, v_y \in \ZZ $ s.t.\ the position of the
  submarine after $t$ hours is given by
  \[
    \mb p(t) = (v_x t + x_0, v_y t + y_0).
  \]
  Note, $\mb p(t)$ is constrained by the parameters $(v_x, x_0, v_y, y_0)$,
  hence our configuration space is simply $\ZZ^4$, which is countable. Hence we
  can simply try each possible configuration of $\mb p(t)$ sequentially, thus
  guaranteeing we'll eventually hit the submarine.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.20]
  Let $A$ be a set, and let $P$ be the set of all functions $f : A \to
  \set{0,1}$. Then $\abs{P} = \abs{\mc P(A)}$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Trivial. Define a bijection by including things in a subset iff the function
  maps it to 1.
\end{proof}
% \begin{problem}[2.22]
%   Prove Cantor's Power Set Theorem.
% \end{problem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Let $A$ be a set. Suppose $A$ is finite. Then 2.18 shows that there can exist
%   no bijection between $A$ and $\mc P(A)$. Now, suppose $A$ is countably
%   infinite, and suppose there exists a bijection $f : A \bij \mc P(A)$. Apply
%   the diagonal argument to obtain a contradiction. Finally, suppose $A$ is
%   uncountable, and that there exists a bijection $f : A \bij \mc P(A)$. Then $f$
%   must remain a bijection when restricted to an arbitrary countable subset.
% \end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.23]
  Consider $A = [0,1]$ and $B = [0,1)$, and consider injections $f : A \into B$,
  $g : B \into A$ defined by
  \[
    f(x) = \frac{x}{3} \qquad g(x) = x
  \]
  constuct a bijection $h : A \bij B$ such that on some points of $A$, $h(x) =
  f(x)$, and for others, $h(x) = g^{-1}(x)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Note $g^{-1}(x) = g(x)$. Then let
  \[
    h(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      f(x) & x \in \QQ \\
      g^{-1}(x) & x \not \in \QQ
    \end{cases}
  \]
  and note that it works.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.24]
  Consider $A$, $B$, and $f$ as before, and let $g(x) = x/2$. Repeat the
  exercise above with this new definition of $g$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $h$ be given by
  \[
    h(x) =
    \begin{cases}
      g^{-1}(x) & \displaystyle \text{if } x \in \bigcup_{n \in \NN}
      \pb{\frac{1}{6^{n}}, \frac{1}{2 \cdot 6^{n-1}}} \\
      f(x) & \displaystyle \text{if } x \in \bigcup_{n \in \NN} \pb{\frac{1}{2
          \cdot 6^{n-1}}, \frac{1}{6^{n-1}}} \\
      0 & \text{if } x = 0
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Clearly, the union of the sets given in the three cases above covers $[0,1]$.
  It remains to show that their images do as well. Note that
  \begin{align*}
    g^{-1}\pn{\bigcup_{n \in \NN} \pb{\frac{1}{6^{n}}, \frac{1}{2 \cdot 6^{n-1}}}}
    &= \bigcup_{n \in \NN} \pb{\frac{1}{3 \cdot 6^{n}}, \frac{1}{6^{n-1}}}
    &
      f\pn{\bigcup_{n\in \NN} \pb{\frac{1}{2 \cdot 6^n}, \frac{1}{6}}}
      &= \bigcup_{n \in \NN} \pb{\frac{1}{6^{n}}, \frac{1}{3 \cdot 6^n}}
  \end{align*}
  and that the union of the right-hand-sides together with $\set{0}$ yields
  $[0,1]$.
\end{proof}
\begin{problem}[2.25]
  Prove the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem. That is, let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
  Suppose there exists injections $f : A \into B$, and $g : B \into A$. Then
  there exists a bijection $h : A \bij B$.
\end{problem}
% \begin{proof}
%   We construct two sequences of sets, as follows. Let $X_1 = A$, and $Y_1 = g(B
%   - f(A))$. Then let $X_2 = A - $
